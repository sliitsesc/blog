With this spirit of collaboration and growth, the first-ever SESC Connect kicked off on the 15th of September 2024 at SLIIT premises organized by the Software Engineering Student Community (SESC). Now you might be wondering eagerly to learn what this whole meetup turned out into. The main motive behind this whole setup was to gather all passionate volunteers and tech enthusiasts to connect, share ideas, and explore opportunities to get involved in exciting initiatives. Participants had the chance to discover upcoming projects, collaborate with like-minded peers and learn about many ways to actively contribute to the Software Engineering Student Community.

The meetup rolled out on a lively afternoon with a warm welcome and to set the stage, a quick introduction was given to dive into what SESC is all about. To break the ice, participants were invited to introduce themselves in a fun and unconventional way—by sharing an embarrassing moment from their lives. Those who hesitated had to sing a few lines of a song, filling the room with laughter and setting a light-hearted tone for the event. The meetup provided an engaging overview of the inspiring projects undertaken by SESC, with glimpses into future plans that sparked curiosity and excitement among the attendees.

The highlight of the day was a creative icebreaker session where participants were divided into groups to perform silent acts based on films, challenging others to guess the titles. The whole room pulsating with energy and action was alive once again with hustle and bustle of people performing onstage. This was followed by a brainstorming challenge, where groups pitched innovative project ideas for SESC. These proposals were evaluated on their originality, budget considerations, and technical feasibility. The winning team was rewarded with gifts, adding an extra touch of excitement to the activity.
