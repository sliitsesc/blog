# Welcome to the Blog of SLIIT SESC!

This repository contains the codebase/content of the SLIIT SESC blog

## Technical stuff for anyone who is wondering

- The blog is built with Next.js
- It uses markdown files to store content (posts)
- The blog pages are generated at the build time and served later
